The fourth task in smart methods 
•	Use python language in IBM Watson to convert speech to text & text to speech
•	Save the output text from (speech to text) as .txt file
•	Save the output speech from (text to speech) as .mp3 file
I can say I am so proud this task is not easy at all I feel the joy of achievement when I fish it. To do this task I create a speech-to-text service using the IBM Watson website which offers an API for integrating spoken recognition into programs. It integrates information about the content of the message with the audio signal's composition. I write python code to convert the audio to text and save the output to a text file then I convert the output to sound and save it as an mp3 file.
